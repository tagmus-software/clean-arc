# Overview

This is a back-end clean architecture project designed with the following technologies:

```bash
  node -v
  # v16+
  tsc -v
  # version 4.4.+
```

##### Directory structure

```bash
-- src/
---- app/
---- infra/
---- interfaces/
```

###### The first path level is split into three different directories

app: for all the business logic and database formatting queries to support business and then inside this folder, you will find the following structure:

```bash
--- repositories/ /** This path is explicit for database communication **/
--- services/  /** this path is explicit for business rules **/
```

infra: everything needed to build the project structure and architecture related, errors exceptions, config environments, database modeling with entities or migrations, providers such as Redis or logs implementation, core and common functionalities inside the project. Follow the structure explained in detail:

```bash
--- common  /** for everything generic that interacts with interfaces, errors exceptions, business unrelated constants. **/
--- config  /** env variables **/
--- core  /** functionalities needed to run the project such as adapters, applications bootstraps **/
--- database  /** connections, migrations, entities, and seeders **/
--- providers  /** redis, logs and rabbitmq(services and connections) **/
```

Interface: it's for transaction data inside in and out of the application, inside the directory we're gonna have jobs, workers, consumers, HTTP api and extra cases if needed. Follow the structure explained in detail:

```bash
--- consumers /** queue contracts normally consuming from some Rabbitmq, Kafka, or Sqs messages **/
--- http /** all rest API interfaces **/
--- jobs /** normally used for some daily task at a specific time, maybe charge some subscription **/
```

## Setup and Install

Steps to setup everything is simple 4 steps to do, follow the steps below:

##### 1ยบ - Environment

you will notice that we have the `.env.example` file in the root directory, create another file named `.env`, and copy and paste the content from `env.example` in your `.env` file. It's something like this.

```bash
APP_NAME='Back-end example'
APP_LOGS=true

MYSQL_PORT=3306
MYSQL_HOST='db'
MYSQL_DATABASE='app'
MYSQL_USERNAME='root'
MYSQL_PASSWORD='example'
```

##### 2ยบ - Dependencies

The project is decoupled from any third parties libraries, so if you decide to work with another logging library or database ORM the choice is up to you, in case yes go ahead and adjust the dependencies and create the adapters for whatever you integrating with. In the meanwhile, we're working with [typeorm](https://typeorm.io/) as our ORM, [express](https://expressjs.com/pt-br/) to provide an HTTP interface and [pinno](https://github.com/pinojs/pino) for logging. Finally to install everything you run:

```bash
npm install
```

##### 3ยบ - Build and Running

If you're here I'll guess everything went great and you only need to get the project running for that go ahead and run the script below in your terminal:

```bash
npm start:dev
```

after your application started you should check if the localhost:3000 or localhost:3200 receive the response "hello world"

#### Production

It would be the following commands

```bash
npm run build
```

and then

```bash
npm start
```

#### docker setup

In case you prefer to use docker, there is a docker-compose file binding everything you need to get the project running

```bash
docker compose up
```

!!!Remember in case of using docker every command should be executed inside the container!!!

## Logging

In case you need to visualize better your terminal output if you're using Pino as your logging tool just install [pino-pretty](https://github.com/pinojs/pino-pretty) with the following command:

```bash
npm install --save-dev pino-pretty
```

and then in the `src/main.ts` file, you edit the line creating your application with the following configuration for pretty log

```typescript
  const app = await ApplicationFactory.createHttpApplication({
    logger: {
      engine: "pino",
      pinoOptions: {
        transport: {
          target: "pino-pretty", // this will load pino pretty
        },
      },
    },
    ...
  })
```

## Database

The following commands for database connection was implemented with [typeorm](https://typeorm.io/), if you feel that you should be using a different ORM go ahead and change, but would be necessary to config the CLI for your setup.

#### Migration

To create migrations you have to run the command specifying the database location you want to create the migration, follow the example below:

```bash
npm run typeorm:migration:create src/infra/database/mysql/migrations/example
```

for running the migration you can use the following:

```bash
npm run typeorm:migration:up
```

and for downgrading the migration would be:

```bash
npm run typeorm:migration:down
```
